# DIC-Net: Upgrade the Performance of Traditional DIC with Hermite Dataset and Convolution Neural Network
Hermite dataset generation implementation (matlab) and DIC-Net CNN implementation (pytorch).

## Introduction
Our method is currently the SOTA of 2D-DeepDIC method in terms of accuracy and spatial resolution(SR).<br>

In the experimental test set with 3216 samples, DIC-Net-d achieves an absolute pixel error (MAE) score of 0.0130 pixels and 0.0126 pixels in the x direction and y direction which is only 48.5% and 47.9% of the prior best method. The spatial resolution (SR) is 17.25 pixels with a noise level of 0.0136, and the metrological performance indicator is 0.234 (lower is better) which outperforms existing traditional and non-traditional methods.
